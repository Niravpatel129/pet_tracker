# pettracker
This is a WIP application that helps pet owners keep track of their pets' nail trims and medications.

Some pets have trouble getting their nails cut, so the owner has to cut one nail a day. Since one might cut only a little bit off to get them used to nail trims, it's easy to lose track. This app would display a pet's "footprints" and the user can mark off which one they did today by simply clicking on the image. It would display what has been already done and what's needed next.
The medicine part would be similar. The user could input, for example, that a dog needs ear drops, twice a day for ten days. The app would display 10 days with two circles in it to be marked off.
Medicine might seem easier to keep track of, but when an individual has multiple dogs with different needs, it can get easy to get lost. 
This app will make pet owners' lives a little bit easier to give them more time to enjoy with their companions.
